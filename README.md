"**S**irCmpwn's **Way**land window manager" is a **work in progress**
i3-compatible window manager for [Wayland](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/).

## Rationale

I use i3 on xorg. Wayland is coming, and [i3way](http://i3way.org/) still has
zero lines of source code after two years.

## Status

- [i3 feature support](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/issues/2)
- [IPC feature support](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/issues/98)
- [i3bar feature support](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/issues/343)
- [i3-gaps feature support](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/issues/307)

## Installation

### From Packages

sway is not supported by many distributions yet. Here's a list of packages
available for you to install:

* [Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sway-git/)
* [Gentoo Linux](https://github.com/zetok/zetok-overlay/)
* [openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/X11:Wayland)
* [Void Linux](https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/sway)

For other distros, [see this wiki page](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/wiki/Install-on-other-distros).

### Compiling from Source

Install dependencies:

* cmake
* [wlc](https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc)
* wayland
* xwayland
* asciidoc
* pcre
* json-c
* pango *
* cairo *
* gdk-pixbuf2 *
* pam **
* imagemagick (required for image capture with swaygrab)
* ffmpeg (required for video capture with swaygrab)

_\*Only required for swaybar, swaybg, and swaylock_

_\*\*Only required for swaylock_

Run these commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR=/etc ..
    make
    sudo make install

On systems without logind, you need to suid the sway binary:

    sudo chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/sway

## Configuration

If you already use i3, then copy your i3 config to `~/.config/sway/config` and
it'll work out of the box. Otherwise, copy the sample configuration file to
`~/.config/sway/config`. It is usually located at `/etc/sway/config`.
Run `man 5 sway` for information on the configuration.

## Running

Instead of running `startx`, run `sway`. You can run `sway` from within X as
well, which is useful for testing.
